To run it first do 

`npm install -g expo-cli`

i used EXPO to do testing in IOS and Android
there is a QR code so you can open the program in both

when you clone the proyect

` npm start `

an EXPO will open the terminal so you can test it.

Here are the list of the points that you send me:

- [x] An input to add tasks. CHECK

- [x] Users should be able to filter between All, Active/Not completed and Done/Completed
tasks. CHECK

- [x] Users should be able to delete and mark tasks as completed.

- [ ] There is no issue if the application data gets lost when the user closes the application
but it would be nice to persist the data. 

- [x] Include the steps to compile and run your application. 

- [x] It needs to work on Android or iOS (one platform is enough)
Not necessary:

- [x] Styling is a nice to have.

- [ ] Testing is a nice to have.
